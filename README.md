# Pandas and Plotly Examples    

## Introduction to Pandas      
* Pandas is an open source library built on thop of NumPy  
* It allows for fast analysis and data cleaning and prepation  
* A lot of people like to call Pandas python version of excel or python version of R data frames   
* Pandas has built-in visualization features  
* Pandas can work with data from a wide veriety or sources  

## Introduction to Plotly   
Plotly's Python graphing library makes interactive, publication-quality graphs online. Examples of how to make line plots, scatter plots, area charts, bar charts, error bars, box plots, histograms, heatmaps, subplots, multiple-axes, polar charts, and bubble charts.

Another data visualizations is Geographical Plotting done on Choropleth Map with Plotly. Geographical plotting is usally challenging to due the various formats the data can come in. Matplotlib also has a basemap extension. 

## Introduction to Cufflinks    
Cufflinks binds the power of plotly with the flexibility of pandas for easy plotting.

## Context
* **Series** (VECTOR) - is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding data of any type (integer, string, float, python objects, etc.). The axis labels are collectively called index.
* **DataFrames** (MATRIX) - A Data frame is a two-dimensional data structure, i.e., data is aligned in a tabular fashion in rows and columns.
* **Missing Data**
* **GroupBy**
* **Merging, Joining, and Concatenating**
* **Operations**
* **Data Input and Output**
